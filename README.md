# Brunt Vaisala frequency 
Buoyanacy oscillation  in a stratified fluid. 
The Brunt-Vaisala frequency (1/s) is a measure of bouyancy. In a continuously stratified fluid, it is the natural frequency of the vertical oscillation of fluid parcels.


If an object of a certain mass M and volume V is released in the water column, instead of the full gravity force, it will experience only a reduced gravity force, called buoyancy force, that makes it sink at a slower rate or even rise in dependence of the density of the ambient medium. The object will oscillate from its equilibrium position. The frequency of this oscillation is called Brunt Vaisala frequency.
