Buoyanacy oscillation  in a stratified fluid


If an object of a certain mass Mobj and volume Vobj is released in the water column, instead of the full gravity force, it will experience only a reduced gravity force, called buoyancy force, that makes it sink at a slower rate or even rise in dependence of the density of the ambient medium.
